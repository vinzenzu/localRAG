How to port Python 2 Code to Python 3
*************************************

Python 2 reached its official end-of-life at the start of 2020. This
means that no new bug reports, fixes, or changes will be made to
Python 2 - it's no longer supported: see **PEP 373** and status of
Python versions.

If you are looking to port an extension module instead of pure Python
code, please see Porting Extension Modules to Python 3.

The archived python-porting mailing list may contain some useful
guidance.

Since Python 3.13 the original porting guide was discontinued. You can
find the old guide in the archive.
