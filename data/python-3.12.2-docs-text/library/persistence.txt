Data Persistence
****************

The modules described in this chapter support storing Python data in a
persistent form on disk.  The "pickle" and "marshal" modules can turn
many Python data types into a stream of bytes and then recreate the
objects from the bytes.  The various DBM-related modules support a
family of hash-based file formats that store a mapping of strings to
other strings.

The list of modules described in this chapter is:

* "pickle" --- Python object serialization
